* Break repeating key XOR

For each keysize, take the first keysize
worth of bytes, and the second keysize worth of bytes and find the
distance between them. Normalize this by dividing by the key size.

The keysize with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably
the correct keysize. You could perhaps proceed with the smallest 2-3
keysize values; or take 4 keysize blocks instead of two and average
each of the pairwise distances.

Answer: A keysize of 29 seems to be the best

I should maybe be careful about the string encoding? I'm not sure if
the substring business I did will actually work correctly

TODO: Something is wrong with my score function. It should actually check the
distribution of letters instead of just scoring according to frequency.
Thinking that the scoring according to frequency would seems kind of silly now.
Distribution would be much more useful.
