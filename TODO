* Break repeating key XOR

For each keysize, take the first keysize
worth of bytes, and the second keysize worth of bytes and find the
distance between them. Normalize this by dividing by the key size.

The keysize with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably
the correct keysize. You could perhaps proceed with the smallest 2-3
keysize values; or take 4 keysize blocks instead of two and average
each of the pairwise distances.
